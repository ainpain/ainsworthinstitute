        %p Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS), formerly known as Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy (RSD) or causalgia, is a chronic and progressive condition characterized by severe pain with often visual changes in the affected area that can include swelling and changes in skin color. For some the area will become hot and sweaty in the beginning, while in the later stages it can become cold to the touch. Patients typically guard the affected limb/area from anyone touching it and sensations as subtle as clothing touching it or the wind can trigger pain so excruciating, some are brought to tears.
