      .article-main-content
        %p This refers to a wide group of facial pain problems which can have many different causes. Atypical facial pain (ATFP) can have many similarities to trigeminal neuralgia and even in the same distribution, however it is rarely as severe with few to no periods of remission. It can also involve the upper neck and scalp. The causes of AFTP can range from infections of the sinuses or teeth, dental work/surgery or trauma.
