        %p Usually abbreviated FBSS, this refers to a condition of chronic and persistent pain following surgery of the neck or back. Whether the surgery was intended as a treatment for pre-existing pain or for any other purpose, it can be described as a return or worsening of the pain from prior, or an entirely new pain in a different area. FBSS is emerging with a steadily growing patient population due in part to a prior increase in the overall number of patients receiving back and neck surgery. The sooner treatment is begun for FBSS, the better the chances of success.
