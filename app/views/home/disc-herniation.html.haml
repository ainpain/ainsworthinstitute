        %p People often use the terms herniating, bulging, and slipped interchangeably when referring to a problem with their discs. While the specifics of which terminology is used may be of more importance to your doctor, the message to a patient is generally the same: “I have an abnormal disc!” When a disc herniates toward the spinal cord, it can produce pressure against it or one of its nerve traveling in the vicinity. This pressure can cause inflammation in the spine or its nerve, which our brains interpret as pain, burning, numbness, etc.
