        %p Muscles, ligaments, tendons and bones can all be a source of pain. This can result from the wear and tear of daily activities, trauma, poor mechanics, overuse, or just forgetting to stretch before physical activity. Typically, this is self-limiting and resolves on its own, over time. In cases where the pain persists, it is important to seek treatment sooner than later, which can include things as simple as a brace and physical therapy.
