        %p This is a neurological disorder involving the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (LFCN). The usual presentation is numbness or pain in the outer thigh which can be accompanied with burning, tingling or numbness. It is not caused by an actual injury to the thigh itself, but rather an injury to the LFCN. This can be brought on by weight gain and/or wearing clothes that are too tight. This can be diagnosed with a test called a Nerve Conduction Study.
