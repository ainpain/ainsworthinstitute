        %p Pain in cancer arises from the tumors growth and subsequent compression of surrounding organs and tissue. As much as 50% of those with cancer suffer from pain, and those that do characterize it as moderate to severe. The pain can be vague and difficult to describe, particularly in those with tumors of the abdomen and pelvic. There are a variety of treatment options and in the vast majority of cases, it can be controlled or even eliminated with careful medication management.
