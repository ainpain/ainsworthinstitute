        %p Back pain is the 5th most common reason for visits to the doctor. 90% of adults experience back pain at some point in their lives, with 50% experiencing back pain every year. Much like neck pain, the causes are just as numerous. Work-related & motor vehicle accidents, slip & falls, sports, and arthritis are frequent offenders, but the list goes on. Causes of the pain can include disc rupture/herniation, inflammation of the spinal cord or facet joints, fracture, narrowing of the spinal canal, and muscle pain â€“ just to name a few.
