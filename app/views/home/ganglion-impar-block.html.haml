        %p.article-paragraph-title Overview
        %p Our goal in pain management is simple: improving quality of life and getting our patients back to the activities they miss because of of pain without surgery. At The Ainsworth Institute, we pride ourselves on treating the whole patient, not just the symptoms or individual findings on an MRI. We believe in a “multi-disciplinary approach” to treating pain which means working carefully with your primary care and/or referring physician (whether that be your surgeon, neurologist, oncologist, psychiatrist or psychologist) and sometimes enlisting the aid of a physical therapist to help get you more active again.

        %p.article-paragraph-title Multidisciplinary Approach
        %p Most patients benefit from a combination of treatments in order to achieve successful pain relief and may be treated by a number of different therapists, chiropractors and other health care providers. Our doctors will work with patients for as long as needed in order to develop an effective treatment plan for their individual condition. To learn more about the pain management services provided at our practice, please call us today to schedule an appointment.
