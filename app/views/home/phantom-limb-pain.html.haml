        %p This is a unique phenomenon that can occur after amputation of a limb. There has been a great deal of research over the last few decades to better understand the process the leads to this. There are 3 main theories: 1. memories of the limbâ€™s position that develop after amputation, 2. maladaptive changes in the sensory portion of the brain, and 3. a conflict in the nervous system between the information provided by vision attempting to send motor commands to the missing body part and the signals actually received.
